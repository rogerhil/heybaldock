Debug False in production and logs

* General
 - Poll
 - PhotoAlbum to Location
 - Insert Image WYSIWYG

* Test again
 - Social Buttons - FB, Twitter, Pinterest etc

* Nice to have:
 - Photo Album associated to Event for flyers, like for location
 - Contact - captcha
 - Contact HTML
 - Icons: success, warning, error, info, etc...
 - Code Comments, Doc tests, License


* Bugs:
 - Album view:
   - Firefox: tempo display in vertical
   - When change tempo, the line breaks, not showing the icon for download and
     actions

* Music Management
 - Cosmetic improvements:
     - Put gettext in all __unicode__
     - Translate remaining items, mainly ChooseOptions
     - Create suggestion box (not important at all)
 - Repertory for event actions like: order by dynamic
 - Permissions for manage past events repertories
 - Events view, improve showing like photo albums, item more detailed with
   image event flyer etc.
 - Find a way to include notify changed/deleted(canceled) repertory, event,
   rehearsal
 - Print action for event repertory
 - Print action for main repertory
 - Replace all alerts to a beautiful alert box
 - Slide show offline for event repertory
 - Mogg upload option for song
 - Option to add/change composers in album view
 - Undo action
 - Repertory item (Event or Main) comments for users (think about using auto-
   complete user tag, like in facebook tags)
 - Event Repertory: option for add song in a list by album and full list
   ordered by columns (very usefull for a beginning of a rehearsal, to have
   an overview)
 - Add require_POST, requery_method, etc decorators in music functions
 - Chat
 - Main Repertory: option for add song in a list by album
 - Think about ratings per player (I think is very usefull, but maybe is not
   practical for user. Maybe create a view for user to allow him to vote
   your instruments and have own statistics)

 - Think about remove QUICK actions for instruments plays in table (for
   performance reasons). Will be a bad idea for the cases which user may
   want add lots of instruments at once in repertory. But, maybe would be
   better remove quick actions like Documents, Audio Segments, Music Score,
   etc.

 - Verify song line, to avoid lots of repeatedely html elements in table,
   for example (menus status, mode, tonality, MAYBE add player)

 - Create a repertory item view, for best edition, and include inside:
   - Document upload;
   - Notes;
   - Music Score:
   - Videos;
   - Audio segments;

 - Document and notes: Think about the items above being shared with other
   players each other, for example: a note or document for the whole repertory
   item, or a single same note or document for 2 or 3 instruments. How to
   implement this in interface. Is this practical? User will get confused?
   Maybe user only document for each player and whole repertory, or just for
   the whole repertory, I don't know.
   Considering the other nice features score, cifra, audio etc, that would
   be very nice to have for each player/instrument, maybe will be enough
   let just document and notes for the repertory item only, nothing else.

 - Lyrics easy download, will be very usefull for the feature below.

 - Music score, tablature, cifra, audio segments, notes:
   - Could be an unique infra structure based on LYRICS!
   - 3 options:
     1. based on lyrics (the base music score (the music score itself) will
        belong to repertory item);
     2. from scratch based on a time signature, free editing, free lyrics,
        blank "pautas"
